I am a third year Ph.D. student in Statistics at the University of British Columbia. My research interests are Bayesian statistics and machine learning, and am currently working with [Dr. Trevor Campbell](https://trevorcampbell.me/) from UBC's [Department of Statistics](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/) on developing fast and accurate large-scale Bayesian inference methods using data summarization techniques.

Apart from academics, I enjoy playing tennis, and work actively as a certified official with Tennis Canada.
