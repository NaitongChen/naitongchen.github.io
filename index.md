I am currently a first year master's student pursuing a M.Sc. degree in Statistics at the University of British Columbia. I am interested in Machine Learning and Bayesian Statistics in general, and am currently exploring the application of data summarization techniques to streaming data.

Currently, I am working with [Dr. Trevor Campbell](https://trevorcampbell.me/) from UBC's [Department of Statistics](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/) on the application of data summarization techniques to streaming data.

Apart from academics, I enjoy playing tennis, and work actively as a certified official with Tennis Canada.
